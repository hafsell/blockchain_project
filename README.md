This project implements a decentralized blockchain network using Hyperledger Fabric, with CouchDB as the state database for each organization, and Hyperledger Explorer for visualizing transactions and blocks. It includes the creation and management of the network, deployment of smart contracts, as well as integration with visualization tools to monitor and analyze transactions in real time.
